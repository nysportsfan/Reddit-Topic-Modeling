    ">### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common problems that the everyday American faces is their financial situation. There are many different reasons for this, such as debt, student loans, the passing of a parent. According to a study of 1000 Americans over the age of 30 (conducted by [GuideVine](https://www.guidevine.com/newsroom/half-americans-age-30-cant-explain-401k/), less than half of Americans understood common financial concepts such as interest, bankruptcy, and inflation. More importantly, more than half felt \"lost\" when it came to having a secure long-term plan for their financial future. This highlights a re-occuring theme in our society where many people have trouble getting by with their finances and naturally some people seek help online. One of these resources is a subreddit called 'Personal Finance', which is hosted on the popular discussion-board website **[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![s](https://github.com/nysportsfan/Personal_Finance_Subreddit/blob/master/Images/PersonalFinance%20Subreddit%20Screenshot.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "**[/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/)** has become a place where many people are able to ask for help regarding their financial situations. A few common topics are savings, budgeting, taxes and debt. There are hundreds of different posts everyday from people of different ages, genders, locations and occupations. Frequent users of the subreddit often provide advice through comments and are able to upvote posts to help it gain more visibility on the front page of /r/personalfinance. However, the main feature we will be focusing on in this project is the \"flair\" feature which enables users to tag their submissions with a topic. For example, if I wrote a post asking advice on paying off my student loans, I would use the 'Debt' flair. This helps organize the hundreds of daily posts into different categories so that people will be able to search them more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main problems with this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "1) <b>Not all users choose a flair for their post, which results in a default 'Other' tag on their post.</b> \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the system will automatically tag the post with 'Other', which is used when the user either doesn't know what topic the post should fall under OR if the user does not assign a topic. This becomes a problem since this can result in many posts not having their proper flair and ruins the organized structure of searching by topic. The 'Other' flair was originally designed to contain posts that did not fall under the other topics but due to the popularity of /r/PersonalFinance (over 13 million subscribers), there are often many new users who do not how to either assign a topic (issue with the interface) or choose a topic (unfamiliar with financial categories). Because of this, the 'Other' flair is usually the most popular and common topic on the subreddit despite the fact that most of the posts actually do fall under another topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be like someone throwing their plastic trash into a regular garbage bin instead of the recycle bin because they were unaware of what the recycle bin is for, they did not see it, or they did not care to throw it into the proper bin. If this was simply a rarity, it could be overlooked but if it becomes a common occurence, it would create a larger problem that would need to be remedied quickly. The same logic applies for properly flairing a post rather than leaving it to 'Other'. \n",
    "\n",
    "![s](http://ahs.mcnairycountyschools.com/uploads/5/2/7/9/52798193/9759366_orig.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "2) <b>There are posts which fit under multiple topics.</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each post can only have a single flair thus forcing users to decide which topic best represents their question or idea. However this can have several repercussions. First, the way a user decides on the topic is very subjective and may not be the best fit. Second, if they don't know which topic to pick for their post, they may decide to simply classify it under 'Other', which goes back to the first problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "3) <b>The current set of available topics may not contain the best variety or be most efficient.</b> \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more interesting problem and can be an analytical problem for another project because it is difficult to ascertain how efficient it is to use the current batch of flairs. One question is whether we should add more topics in order to reduce the number of 'Other' posts and to also make it easier for users to identify the proper flair for their submissions. For example, should we include a new 'Student' topic for questions pertaining to student loans, textbook savings, getting a campus job, etc. Another question is whether or not we can *remove* any of the current topics and replace it with something else. This is not to say that the current topics are bad; in fact, using an eye-test would be enough for most people to be satisfied with them but how do we know whether or not they are the most efficient set of topics? \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up these 3 main problems into a single question: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>How can we create an efficient set of topics and automatically assign a single one for each post?</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    ">### The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>The main goal of this project is to create a topic-modeling algorithm that will generate a new set of topics for /r/personalfinance posts.</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will consist of 4 stages to accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) [Data Acquisition](#1.-Data-Acquisition)**: This is often the most important step in any data science project (along with cleaning the data). We will first need to acquire the relevant data from /r/personalfinance using pushshift.io's API as well as Reddit's official API. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) [Data Wrangling](#2.-Data-Wrangling)**: After we extract the data, we will need to clean it and prepare it for analysis. Natural Language Processing projects require pre-processing the text so that the machine readily able to interpret it after vectorization. Any incoherent symbols or punctuation will make the model performance worse so this is crucial before creating the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) [Exploratory Data Analysis](#3.-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)**: We will begin to explore the data and observe any interesting trends that can provide a direction or foundation for how we proceed with the project. Natural Language Processing projects are typically limited in how much EDA can be performed because of the lack of features. After all, we are mainly dealing with text!\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) [Machine Learning](#4.-Machine-Learning)**: Let us split the problem statement into 2 parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>First, how can we create topics based on the posts' text and assign one to each post?</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main type of algorithm we seek to use is a topic model, which discovers topics based on hidden semantic structures in the various documents of a corpus (which is a large unstructured set of text). More specifically, this will require the implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a generative statistical model that works well in topic modeling by mapping each document to a number of different topics and each topic to a number of different words. To evaluate how well a generated set of topics does in clustering the documents, we will be using 2 metrics: Perplexity and Coherence (this will be discussed in greater detail in the machine learning section).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Second, how do we evaluate whether or not these topics are efficient?</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- To answer this question, we must think about how we can define an \"efficient\" topic. Remember that we want this model to be able to not only do well in creating topics for the fitted data, but also do a good job in assigning topics for *new* posts. The problem we face is that there are many incidents where a user does not select a topic for their own posts. Therefore this model should help resolve this issue by automatically creating a topic for these new posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best way to evaluate the efficiency of the new topics that we generate from our topic model is by measuring the accuracy of predicting the labels. In other words, we will be creating a new classification problem where the feature variables are the text for each post and the response variable is the generated topic for each post. We then use different machine learning algorithms (such as Naive Bayes and Stochastic Gradient Descent) to create a good model that can predict the topics for a given row. Finally, we use the Accuracy, Precision and Recall metrics to evaluate how well the model performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "Note: We did not use inferential statistics to do hypothesis testing or to observe relationships between the feature and response variables. This is because our feature variables are the vectorized form of words and there are thousands of different words in our usable dictionary, which would make any statistical insight practically meaningless.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    ">### The Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **/r/PersonalFinance Users** will be interested in having a new system that could automatically determine a proper topic for their submission so that they don't have to choose one themselves. Whether they are too lazy, don't know which topic to select This will also help other people who search posts by topic. For example, if someone was interested in reading advice for people struggling with low income, they could simply navigate through the 'Planning' topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "![s](https://watermarked.cutcaster.com/cutcaster-photo-100747197-Cartoon-boy-working-with-computer.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "2) **/r/PersonalFinance Moderators** will benefit from having a clearer structure for all submissions. Many of the popular subreddits insist on their members tagging their posts with flairs because of the convenience and organization it provides to the subreddit as a whole (sometimes this is even a requirement). One of the problems that moderators face with their subreddits is the influx of re-occuring questions. Many subreddits will ask users to first search for similar posts before submitting their own because it helps to reduce the number of the same posed questions. By having a better topic system, this will help the search feature because there will be fewer 'Other' posts and more of the specific topics. \n",

    ">**Obtaining the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this report, I created my own dataset through 2 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First**, we extract the submission information using the __[pushshift.io Reddit API](https://github.com/pushshift/api)__. It gives us the ability to search through Reddit data and create data aggregations. Using sqlite was necessary as there are many different rows of data to collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to first specify the date ranges from which we can extract the data. This is important so that we can attach the date ranges to the pushshift url. For example, if we wanted to extract the newest post submissions as of August 25th 2018 for /r/nba (a subreddit for fans of the National Basketball Association), we would first convert August 25th 2018 11:59:59 PM into datetime format and then into a timestamp using the .timetuple() method. We then add the subreddit and timestamp as strings in the url. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would be the resulting url: http://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission/?subreddit=personalfinance&size=500&before=1535255999\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a quick look!\n",
    "\n",
    "![s](https://github.com/nysportsfan/Personal_Finance_Subreddit/blob/master/Images/Pushshift%20IO%20Example.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this will provide the 500 most recent posts as of August 25th 11:59PM because we specified size = 500. We then use the requests module to use its builtin JSON decoder and extract the relevant data from each pull. To get the next 500 most recent posts, we simply do another pull by replacing the timestamp such that it comes right after the date and time of the 500th post. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**, I used the __[official Reddit API](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)__ to extract information that is not provided through the pushshift.io Reddit API. In this case, we extracted the flair (which will act as the \"topics\" of each submission) and self-text information (which are the body of text for each submission). The reason we cannot simply use the official Reddit API to extract all the submission data is because they limit the number of submissions (1000) you are allowed to extract as well as the date range. For example, if we extract the 1000 most recent posts on a subreddit, we cannot extract the next 1000 most recent posts since we cannot specify the date range. We will have a dataset that contains approximately 100,000 rows of data. Each row represents a submission in the Personal Finance subreddit. The features will include:\n",

    "- title\n",
    "\n",
    "- date (the date at which the post was submitted)\n",
    "\n",

    "As we can see, the histogram of the distribution of the text length is abnormally right-skewed with a strong kurtosis. While the graph peaks around 75-100 characters, it is difficult to tell where the mean of the data is if we only look at the graph. In reality, the mean number of characters for the posts is 602, which is far from the peak of the data. There is a strong peak but after about 150 words is a very flat-lined distribution where it gradually increases up until 600 and then begins to decline. \n",

    "One interpretation of this graph can be that there are many new users who simply want to ask a quick question without going into much detail. For example, a person may want to ask about whether they should get a Visa or MasterCard credit card. These types of posts are very common where people do not have to adequately describe their financial situation to get advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interpretation is that many of the posts get deleted, resulting in the self-text disappearing and significantly reducing the number of characters in the total text. This is certainly plausible because of how many subscribers /r/personalfinance has. The more popular a subreddit becomes, the more common it is for new users to disregard the subreddit's rules and consequently, a higher chance that a moderator removes their post. In fact, the mean number of characters for posts under the 'unknown' topic (which is for posts that have been deleted or removed) is 130, which is well below the average of 602.\n",

    "\n",
    "> #### How LDA Works\n",
    "\n",
    "A corpus can be represented in vector space by a document-word matrix which contains the frequency of every word in a corpus against every document in the corpus. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![s](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Cutkosky/publication/220677827/figure/fig2/AS:394013053079585@1470951440970/ector-space-representation-of-a-document-collection-or-corpus-matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $c\\scriptsize11$ represents the number of times the word 'schedule' appears in the document 'Memo'. So how does this relate to creating the topics? What LDA does is essentially split this $M x N$ matrix into 2 lower dimensional matrices, which we will call $A1$ and $A2$. $A1$ is a document-topics matrix whereas $A2$ is a topic-word matrix. Let the number of topics be $K$; $A1$ is therefore a $M x K$ matrix while $A2$ is a $K x N$ matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are now 2 major steps in how it assigns a topic to each document:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The model first *randomly* assigns a set of $K$ topics to each document. In other words, these topics can be completely wrong in how well it represents the clusters of documents. You can think of them as dummy topics at this point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Each topic generates words based on their probability distribution. For example, if 'dog' appears more frequently than other words in documents with topic 1, then 'dog' will have a strong weight in topic 1. By repeatedly iterating through the different words in each document, the model attempts to adjust itself by assigning a new word to a topic. If the model discovers that the word 'dog' is infrequent in topic 2, then it will correct itself by replacing 'dog' with another word with a higher probability $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we calculate $P$ is through multiplying 2 smaller probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) $P(topic\\;t|document\\;d)$ - the proportion of words in document $d$ that are currently assigned to topic $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) $P(word\\;w|topic\\;t)$ - the proportion of assignments to topic $t$ over all documents that come from the word $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $P$ is the probability that topic $t$ generated word $w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below describes how LDA functions in a nutshell. Each topic has a discrete probability distribution of words and each document is composed of a mixture of topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "![s](http://bigdata.ices.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LDA-concept.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Creating the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually creating the model using gensim's LDA model is a relatively straight-forward process because we only need to input 2 parameters into gensim's LDA model, the corpus of text and the dictionary. However, in order to optimize the model there are additional parameters that we need to focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **number of topics (num_topics)** - The number of topics that are created from the bag-of-words\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **alpha value (alpha)** - The alpha value controls the mixture of topics for any given document. The greater the alpha, the greater the variety of topics will appear for any given document. The lower the alpha, the lower the variety of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Griffiths and Steyvers (2004), it is suggested to use a value of 50/k (where k is number of topics) for α. However, gensim allows us to specify 'auto' for the alpha parameter, which causes the machine to automatically estimate alpha based off of the corpus we train with. This conveniently means that we won't have to test out different alpha values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which are the best hyper-parameters, we will be testing different number of topics and evaluating each iteration of the model based on its performance on its **coherence value**. Coherence is the measure of how much a document makes sense given the context of the words in relation to each other. For example, a coherence score of 0.10 would indicate that the model did a poor job at creating topics for similar documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the results when we use gensim's built in LDA wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "![s](https://github.com/nysportsfan/Personal_Finance_Subreddit/blob/master/Images/PersonalFinance%20Coherence%20Graph.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Coherence score peaks when the number of topics is equal to 20. This means that the LDA model produces the most coherent and best variety of clustered documents when there are 20 topics. Therefore this would be the most \"optimal\" number of topics. Let's also use the __[pyLDAvis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis)__ package to display how the topics vary in relation to each other."

While using a bag-of-words model does the job in counting the frequency of each word per document, we want to better quantify the signature words which don't appear as frequently as common words. For this reason, we will also introduce a **term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf) model**.

The new topics that the generated topics did not have in common with the originals were 'Bank Account', 'Collections', 'Credit Card', 'Loans', and 'School'.

    ">**Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Split up the Debt topic into Collections, Loans, and Debt**: After generating the new topics, the posts with the original 'debt' topic have primarily split up into 2 camps: 'collections' and 'loans'.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) *Collections*: This was a surprisingly popular theme among quite a few posts. Throughout the different machine learning models, collections consistently had among the better accuracy scores as well. It makes sense from a practical standpoint why collections should be added as a topic; while collections is typically a sub-category of debt, it happens frequently enough as a result of scams and fraudulent activity that it should be in a category of its own. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) *Loans*: Even more common than collections were the posts regarding loans. These included, student loans, mortgage loans, auto loans, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "c) *Debt*: For all other types of debt, such as medical debt or utility bills, these can go to here. One suggestion would be to instead use 'Billing' as a topic instead of 'Debt'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Differentiate Credit and Credit Card topics**: While credit cards are used to build up our credit scores and improve our credit history, almost all posts under the original 'Credit' tag were about credit cards. There were more posts about credit cards than there were posts categorized under the 'Credit' tag. The few posts that were not about improving their credit via using their credit cards had to deal with their loans. In this case, it would be better to simply use a 'Credit Card' topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Use Machine Learning to assign topics to untagged posts**: Rather than letting the system assign 'Other' to an untagged post by default, it would be better to use machine learning to assign topics. By using the newly generated topic set, there was over a 10% decrease in the number of posts tagged with 'Other' while still maintaing over an 80% accuracy rate. To maintain as much accuracy as possible, we can adjust the model so that it will only assign a topic to an untagged post if it has over a certain percentage similarity match to a topic. For example, if we set the threshold to 50% and a post about Walgreens has a 54% match to 'Budgeting', the model will assign 'Budgeting' to be its topic. This threshold can be selected by the moderators of /r/personalfinance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Limitations of the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "One pattern we did notice throughout all the models is the fact that the 'other' topic did a very poor job in both precision and recall. In other words, the model often falsely labeled non-'other' posts as 'other' and also did not correctly label 'other' posts as 'other'. If we had to choose between avoiding a Type I error (misclassifying 'other' posts as not 'other') and a Type II error (misclassifying non-'other' posts as 'other'), the former would be preferred. This is because the topic 'other' is a mixture of several topics whereas the other topics have a stricter definition of what kinds of posts and words belong to that category. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an 'auto' post about car insurance was labeled as 'other', it would not be as damaging as if an 'other' post about a grandmother leaving behind a will was labeled as 'school'. There are also cases where the author of the post does not know what the topic should be; in this situation, they would most likely categorize the post under \"other\" rather than falsely labeling it as something definitive in nature. In a sense, the 'other' topic could be seen as a wildcard when \n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem does not have to do so much with the classification model, but with the topic-modeling. There are certain cases where a post was labeled under a topic that does not make sense to a human observer. Because the machine makes its decisions using vectorized inputs, it is unable to accurately classify each post 100% of the time. As a result, there are some exceptions where the classification model actually \"corrects\" the topic-modeling mistakes and labels some posts with the \"right\" topic. One explanation for this limitation is the fact that each document (or post) is assigned a number of different topics and we simply chose the topic with the highest similarity percentage as the label. This may work well for most posts but there are scenarios where this line of thinking can backfire.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what if a post about college loans had a 34% contribution from 'loans' but 33% contribution from 'school'? In this case, the model would categorize this post under the 'loans' topic but the classification model may predict it as 'school'. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Final Thoughts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic-modeling is still very much a work-in-progress due to the fact that technology continues to adapt and evolve at a rapid pace. It especially requires an \"eye-test\" approach to refining and improving the models because text is not as easily interpreted by the machine compared to numbers. Therefore the user will need to verify whether or not the generated topics \"work\" by looking at several factors such as how much the topics make sense given the type of words that surround the topic, how many documents fit under each topic (if there are too many documents under 1 topic and too few under another, it is practically useless), etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, these results looked good considering the fact that the topics were generated by the machine rather than by humans."
